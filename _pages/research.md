In my research, I address questions of **sustainability in supply chains**, including:
- How can a company incentivize their suppliers to adhere to sustainability standards?
- How can they support the suppliers in doing so?
- How does that look like in multi-tier supply chains, and which role can transparency initiatives play here?

With this, I want to understand why sustainability problems persist along global supply chains, and which levers are most effective to address them.

I talk about this at **conferences**:
- European Operations Management Association (EurOMA) Conference - 2023 - Leuven, Belgium
- Production and Operations Management Society (POMS) Annual Conference - 2023 - Orlando, Florida
- Manufacturing and Service Operations Management (M&SOM) Conference - 2022 - Munich
- International Working Seminar on Production Economics - 2022 - Innsbruck (online)

Other presentations include:
- "Sustainability through Supply Chain Transparency", TUM Sustainability Day, June 2024
- "Urbane Logistik: nachhaltig und flexibel?", Ringvorlesung "Zukunft der Mobilit√§t" / Lecture series "Future of Mobility", openLAB Urban Mobility, July 2024
