In my research, I address questions of **sustainability in supply chains**, including:
- How can a company incentivize its suppliers to adhere to sustainability standards?
- How can they support the suppliers in doing so, and what does that look like in multi-tier supply chains?
- What role can transparency initiatives play here?

With this, I want to understand why sustainability problems persist along global supply chains, and which levers are most effective in addressing them.

**Publications** on these topics are:
- Bloemer, A. (2024). Warum Unternehmen zur Veröffentlichung ihrer Lieferketten verpflichtet werden sollten. *Makronom*. ([Link](https://makronom.de/warum-unternehmen-zur-veroeffentlichung-ihrer-lieferketten-verpflichtet-werden-sollten-47164) and [pdf]()). English version coming soon.
- Bloemer, A. & Minner, S. (2024). Unveiling the Supply Chain: The Interaction of Sustainability, Transparency and Digital Technologies. In P. Evangelista, J. Hallikas, & M. Y. Jaber (Eds.), *Environmentally Responsible Supply Chains in an Era of Digital Transformation* (pp. 136-159). Edward Elgar Publishing.
- Journal articles are currently under review.

I also talk about this at **conferences**:
- European Operations Management Association (EurOMA) Conference - 2023 - Leuven, Belgium
- Production and Operations Management Society (POMS) Annual Conference - 2023 - Orlando, Florida
- Manufacturing and Service Operations Management (M&SOM) Conference - 2022 - Munich
- International Working Seminar on Production Economics - 2022 - Innsbruck (online)

Other presentations include:
- "Sustainability through Supply Chain Transparency", TUM Sustainability Day, June 2024
- "Urbane Logistik: nachhaltig und flexibel?", Ringvorlesung "Zukunft der Mobilität" / Lecture series "Future of Mobility", openLAB Urban Mobility, July 2024
