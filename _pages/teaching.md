Every winter semester, I teach **Sustainable Supply Chain Management**, a seminar-like course for 30-35 master students at TUM.

*What?* In this course, we discuss the main concepts of designing supply chains to be as sustainable as possible, including for example life cycle assessments, transparency initiatives, sustainable (urban) logistics, closed-loop supply chains and circularity, supplier selection, and governance mechanisms.
We also shortly cover related concepts like humanitarian logistics.

*Why?* The goal is to educate students about the huge lever supply chain management has on sustainability, which approaches are available, and why addressing supply chain sustainability may not always be as straightforward and intuitive as expected.

*Who?* In the winter semesters of 2021/2022 and 2022/2023, I taught this course together with my lovely colleague Chunting Liu, Ph.D.
Since winter 2023/2024, I teach the course by myself.

*Opinions?* On average, students evaluate my teaching in the course with the grade 1.17 (1 best, 5 worst). Some opinions on the course from the anonymous evaluation include:
- "I believe it is a really good course that provides the students with a lot of important information about a topic that has a direct impact on the quality of our lives."
- "I think the content, plan, and presentation of the topics were perfect. Mr. Bloemer has a great expertise and experience on the content of the course. He is always kind and mentors you if you have questions. I have really enjoyed every part of the course and unfortunately, I don't have any feedback to help improve the course because I believe it was really top tier. Thank you for everything!!"
- "Alex is very enthusiastic about the course, and his lecturing style is easy to listen to and participate."
- "I really enjoyed the course. It was inspiring, and I learned a lot. Thanks!"
- "Mister Bloemer was a great lecturer and really sparked my interest in the subject."
- "Alexander is very interested in the subject, very open and approachable, which improves the learning experience."
- "Alexander is doing a great job and from my point of view the way this seminar taught should be a "role model" for other courses."

Every summer semester, the teaching mode changes with the fundamentals course **Logistics and Supply Chain Management** for 1300-1400 bachelor and master students at TUM.
Here, I support Prof. Minner in preparing the content, give some lectures during the semester in the Audimax (which is always exciting), coordinate the 12 tutors conducting 24 weekly tutorials, organize the exams etc.

Additionally, I supervise **Bachelor and Master Theses** as well as **Project Studies** and **Interdisciplinary Projects**.
A selection of topics (mostly master theses) includes:
- Disclosing the List of Suppliers for Supply Chain Sustainability
- Impact of International Relations and Geopolitics on Supply Chain Design, Sustainability, and Resilience
- Improving Supply Chain Transparency through Consumer Pressure for Sustainability
- Sustainable Resource Usage in the Fast Fashion Industry
- Green Supply Chains for Green Technologies: A Pathway towards a Closed-Loop Rare Earth Supply Chain in the European Union
- Dynamic Auditing Decisions to Incentivize Supply Chain Sustainability – A Markovian Approach
- Sustainability as a Driver of Long-Term Supply Chain Resilience
- How to Manage Sustainability Trade-Offs? A Comparison of Methods for Multi-Criteria Decision Making
- Risk Management in Supply Chains: The Example of the Semiconductor Crisis in the Automotive Industry
- Sustainability in Motorsports – Life Cycle Analysis of a Large-Scale Motorsport Event
- The Principal-Agent Problem in Municipal Plastic Waste Collection
- Simulation and Visualization for Sustainable Supply Chains
- Blockchain Technology for Supply Chain Sustainability
- Legislative Advances in Supply Chain Sustainability
- Sustainable Urban Mobility: Innovations in Last Mile Delivery
- Market Entry Opportunities for Charging Infrastructures in Urban Areas across Europe
- Social Media Crawling for Sustainable and Resilient Supply Chains
- Decarbonization of Aviation within an EU Framework

Finally, I supervise students in our chair's **Advanded Seminar** every semester, where students gain experience in conducting research before starting with their thesis.
