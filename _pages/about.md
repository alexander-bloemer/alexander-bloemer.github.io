I talk and write about **[sustainability and transparency in supply chains](/research/)**.

I'm a **[research assistant](https://www.ot.mgt.tum.de/log/team/bloemer/)** at the Technical University of Munich, Chair for Logistics and Supply Chain Management.
My Ph.D. supervisor is [**Prof. Dr. Stefan Minner**](https://www.ot.mgt.tum.de/log/team/minner/).
In the spring semester of 2024, I was a visiting researcher at North Carolina State University, working under the supervision of [**Prof. Tim Kraft, Ph.D.**](https://poole.ncsu.edu/people/tim-kraft/)

Before starting my Ph.D., I studied at the University of Cologne (B.Sc.), the Technical University of Munich (M.Sc.), and Lund University in Sweden (Erasmus Exchange).
